# flutter-project_1
This is my first flutter project, done with the help from "Google for Developer" website, under the badge name "Build Apps with Flutter"
<br>
<br>
This app generates user names by randomly combining words from the data/library (provided by the course) using '_' (under_score).
<br>
The user can also save their favourite generated names and view them all on a separate page.
